Kevon Grant Looney (born February 6, 1996) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriorsof the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a freshman playing college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12 in 2014–15. After the season, he decided to forgo his college eligibility and enter the 2015 NBA draft, and was subsequently selected in the first round by Golden State with the 30th overall pick. He won an NBA championship with the Warriors in 2017.</P>
<p>
Growing up in Wisconsin, Looney was named the top high school player in the state as a senior in 2014. He also received national recognition as a five-star prospect and earned All-American honors. In his only season at UCLA, he led all freshmen in the nation in double-doubles, recording double figures in both points and rebounds in 15 games. One of the top players in the Pac-12, he was also named to their all-freshman team. As a rookie with Golden State, Looney's playing time was limited after undergoing surgery on both of his hips. The following season, a strained left hip sidelined him for most of the playoffsduring their championship run.

<p>Looney announced on Halloween in 2013 his decision to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). No recruiting analysts at 247Sports.com had predicted his decision, which was a secret to everyone including his parents.[7]Looney liked California, and called UCLA the "most beautiful campus I had ever seen."[6] He was impressed with UCLA coach Steve Alford's vision for the team.[11] The Bruins did not guarantee Looney a feature role as a freshman, but sold to him that he would be allowed to play both inside and outside and show his versatility, much like Kyle Anderson did for the Bruins in 2013–14.[2]

<p>Looney was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Doug and Victoria Looney.[1] As a youngster, he watched his older brother Kevin, who was six years older, play pickup games. Like his brother, Looney became a Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant fan, and would watch tapes of Bryant and copy the Lakers star's moves</p>

Looney was the best player on his high school team at Alexander Hamilton High in Milwaukee.[2][3] He was already being recruited by colleges as a freshman, receiving offers from in-state schools Marquette and Wisconsin.[4] In his sophomore year in 2012, he was named Player of the Year of the Milwaukee City Conference after averaging 20.9 points, 8.6 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game.[1][5] As a junior, Looney averaged 26.1 points, 12.4 rebounds, 7.0 blocks and 3.1 assists per game, and led a team of mostly unproven players to a runner-up finish for the conference title.[1][6]

In his final season, he averaged 27.9 points, 12.7 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 8.0 blocks per game;[1] both CBS Sports and The Post-Crescent called his averages "nearly" a quadruple-double.[7][8] Though he was Hamilton's tallest player, he was also their best passer, and played mostly at point guard.[2][9] Hamilton went undefeated in conference play to win its first league title in four years,[10]and Looney earned his second City Conference player of the year award.[9] He gained national recognition, becoming just the second player in Milwaukee Public Schools history, and the sixth ever in Wisconsin, to be named a McDonald's All-American; he was a Parade All-American as well.[3][9] Looney was named Wisconsin Mr. Basketball by the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association, and Gatorade and the Associated Press named him their state player of the year.[10] He was listed as a five-star prospect by Rivals.com, ESPN.com and Scout.com, who ranked him nationally as the No. 10, No. 12, and No. 15 player, respectively.[1]
