<p>After going undrafted in the 2014 NBA draft, McAdoo joined the Golden State Warriors for the 2014 NBA Summer League.[8] On September 2, 2014, he signed with the Warriors,[9] but was later waived by the team on October 24.[10] On November 3, 2014, he was acquired by the Santa Cruz Warriors as an affiliate player of Golden State.[11]

On January 19, 2015, McAdoo signed a 10-day contract with the Golden State Warriors.[12] He made his NBA debut later that night as he came off the bench to record 11 points and 5 rebounds in the 122–79 win over the Denver Nuggets.[13] He was not retained by Golden State following the expiration of his contract on January 29,[14] and he returned to Santa Cruz the following day.[15] On February 2, he returned to Golden State, signing a second 10-day contract with the team.[16] Following the expiration of his second 10-day contract, he returned to Santa Cruz where he played two games before being called up again by Golden State on February 19, signing with the team for the rest of the 2014–15 season.[17] He was assigned multiple times to Santa Cruz to finish the season,[18] as he earned NBA D-League All-Rookie first team and All-NBA D-League second team honors.[19] He went on to a D-League championship with Santa Cruz[20] and an NBA championship with Golden State; he appeared in just over a minute of action for the Warriors during the 2015 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[21]

McAdoo retained his spot on Golden State's roster for the 2015–16 season, but missed all of January and February because of a sprained toe on his left foot.[22] On March 21, 2016, he made his first career NBA start, recording seven points and six rebounds in 17½ minutes of action in a 109–104 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[23] The Warriors returned to the NBA Finals in 2016, where they were defeated in seven games by the Cavaliers.

On July 13, 2016, McAdoo re-signed with the Warriors.[24] The Warriors won 67 games in the 2016–17 season and made their way through to their third straight NBA Finals series. There the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games to claim their second championship in three years.
