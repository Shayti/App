Thompson was selected in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by Golden State with the 11th overall pick. In 2014, he and teammate Stephen Curry set a then NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season,[2] as the pair were given the nickname the "Splash Brothers".[3][4] Thompson is a three-time NBA All-Star and a two-time All-NBA Third Team honoree. In 2015, he helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA Championship since 1975.

Thompson was born in Los Angeles to Julie and Mychal Thompson. His mother was a volleyball player in college, and his dad was the first overall pick of the 1978 NBA draft.[5] At age 2, Thompson's family moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon, where he was childhood friends and Little League teammates with fellow future NBA star Kevin Love.[6] At age 14, Thompson moved with his family to Ladera Ranch, California, and graduated from Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Rancho Santa Margarita in 2008.[1] In his junior season he was named to the All-Area second team and to the Orange County third team. As a senior Thompson averaged 21 points per game and led SMCHS to a 30–5 record and a Division III State Championship appearance.[1][7] During the state championship, Thompson set a state finals record with seven 3-pointers in a game.[7] He was named Division III State player of the year, League MVP, first-team Best in the West, and an EA Sports Second Team All American.[1]

Thompson declared for, and opted to remain in, the 2011 NBA draft after his junior season. He was selected 11th overall by the Golden State Warriors.[17] This pick of a guard prompted speculation that the Warriors would trade starting guard Monta Ellis.[18] Warriors general manager Larry Riley praised Thompson for his shooting ability and expressed confidence that Thompson would improve his defensive skills with new coach Mark Jackson. </p>

The NBA did not select Thompson for the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend Rising Stars Challenge. However, in the four games after that decision, Thompson improved in all areas of basketball over his current season averages: points per game (12.5 over 7.6), shooting percentage (54.3% overall including 55.6% for three-pointers, up from 46.7 and 48.1), rebounds (2.8 from 1.6), assists (1.5 from 1.3), steals, and turnovers.[19] The Warriors traded Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks on March 13, 2012.[20] The following game, Thompson scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics.[21] A week later, he exceeded his previous high with 27 points in a win over the New Orleans Hornets.[22] As of mid-February 2012, Thompson played around 17 minutes per game,[19] but he played an average 30 minutes per game during the next month.[23] At the end of the season, Thompson was voted to the NBA NBA All-Rookie First Team.
