<h1>Draymond Green</h1></center>

<font size="50"><p>Draymond Jamal Green Sr. (born March 4, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Green, who plays primarily at the power forward position, was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team and won his first NBA Championship with the Warriors in 2015. Green was named an NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team member the following two seasons. In 2017, he won NBA Defensive Player of the Year and his second NBA Championship as a member of the Warriors.

Green grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, and played college basketball for Michigan State, where he helped the Spartans earn two Final Four appearances and a Big Ten Tournament championship in 2012. Throughout his four-year college career, Green earned conference and national honors, including Big Ten Conference Sixth Man of the Year as a sophomore, and consensus All-American and NABC National Player of the Year honors as a senior. He went on to be drafted 35th overall in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, and later played a key role on the Warriors' 2015 championship team.
Green, who often plays significant minutes for the Warriors as an undersized center in their so-called 'death lineup', has been cited as one of the leaders in an emerging trend in the NBA of versatile frontcourt players capable of playing and defending multiple positions, making plays for teammates and spacing the floor.

<p>Green was selected with the 35th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. On July 30, 2012, he signed a three-year, $2.6 million contract with the Warriors.[10] In his NBA debut in the Warriors' season opener on October 31 against the Phoenix Suns, Green played one minute, made one defensive rebound, and committed one foul.[11] Green gradually received more playing time in subsequent games, especially in the wake of injuries to Brandon Rush and Richard Jefferson.[12] After getting only marginal floor time at the beginning of the season, by November 22, Green was playing 15–20 minutes per game,[13] and by December 9, as Green gained a bigger role on the team, the Warriors had won 8 of 10 games. On December 12, Green made the winning layup with 0.9 second left in the Warriors' 97–95 win over the defending champion Miami Heat.[14][15]
In Game 1 of the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs against the Denver Nuggets on April 20, Nuggets' guard Andre Miller drove around Green and made the game-winning layup in the Nuggets' 97–95 win over the Warriors. Improving on his three-point percentage and offensive performance over the course of the series, Green helped the Warriors win the first round in six games.[16][17] On May 8, Green started Game 2 of the Warriors' second-round series against the San Antonio Spurs. In the Warriors' 100–91 victory, the Warriors' first victory in San Antonio since the 1996–97 season, Green started in place of Festus Ezeli.[18] Green played 32 minutes and recorded 5 points on 2-of-8 shooting, 7 rebounds and 5 assists.[19] The Spurs went on to win the series 4 games to 2, subsequently ending the Warriors' season and playoff run.

Green lost 20 pounds in the 2013 off-season and showed improvement in three-point shooting and defense as a sophomore.[20] On December 1, 2013, in the Warriors' 115–113 win over the Sacramento Kings, Green tipped in a missed shot by Stephen Curry to give the Warriors a 113–111 lead with 28.7 seconds left; the Kings trailed by as many as 16 in the game.[21] On December 25, Green was ejected from the Warriors' game against the Los Angeles Clippers for committing a flagrant 2 foul on the Clippers' forward Blake Griffin.[22] The following day, the NBA fined Green $15,000 for "failing to leave the court in a timely manner" after being ejected.[23] Late in the season, he filled in at power forward for injured starter David Lee, who was out indefinitely.[24] On April 14, 2014, in the Warriors' second to last game of the regular season, Green recorded a career-high 20 points and a career high-tying 12 rebounds off the bench to help his team defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves, 130–120.

Green finished the 2013–14 season having played in all 82 games with 12 starts while averaging 6.2 points and 5.0 rebounds per game. He went on to play in all seven of the Warriors' first-round playoff games against the Los Angeles Clippers, as the Warriors lost the series 4 games to 3. He earned praise for his tough defense during the series after averaging 1.7 steals and 1.7 blocks per game.</p>

With the Warriors' resurgence in 2014–15, along with it came the breakthrough the Warriors were hoping for from Green. With David Lee out of the Warriors' lineup with a hamstring injury to begin the season, Green was promoted to the starting lineup as his replacement at power forward. Over the first seven games of the season, Green averaged 13.6 points per game as the Warriors fell to a 5–2 record after losing two games in a row on November 9 and 11. In response to the two-game losing streak, the Warriors went on a 16-game winning streak with the help of Green as he averaged 13.3 points per game over the streak,[27] including a career-high 31 points on December 6 in a 112–102 win over the Chicago Bulls.[28]
On January 2, 2015, Green recorded his first career triple-double with 16 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists in a 126–105 win over the Toronto Raptors.[29] He went on to finish runner-up in both the Defensive Player of the Year Award and the Most Improved Player Award.[30][31] Green capped off a great season with an NBA championship and a triple-double in Game 6 of the NBA Finals, playing a center position role in place of Andrew Bogut.[32] He became just the sixth player in NBA history to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals clinching game, joining Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, James Worthy, Tim Duncan and LeBron James.

On July 9, 2015, Green re-signed with the Warriors to a five-year, $82 million contract.[33][34] Green helped the Warriors record their first ever 10–0 start to a season behind averages of 11.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, a team-high 6.6 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.2 blocks per game.[35] On November 24, he recorded 18 points and 7 rebounds in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers as the Warriors set the record for best start in NBA history at 16–0.[36] Three days later, he recorded his third career triple-double with 14 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 135–116 win over the Phoenix Suns.[37] His fourth career triple-double came the very next game on November 28 against the Sacramento Kings. Green had 13 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists against the Kings, becoming the first Warriors player with back-to-back triple-doubles since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964.

On December 11, Green became the first player since Nicolas Batum in 2012 to record five or more in all five major statistical categories. In just under 50 minutes of action, he recorded 24 points, 11 rebounds, 8 assists, 5 steals and 5 blocks in a 124–119 double overtime win over the Boston Celtics, increasing their unbeaten winning streak to the start the season to 24–0.[39] The following day, the Warriors' unbeaten run was broken by the Milwaukee Bucks, losing their first game of the season 108–95 despite Green's 24-point, 11-rebound effort.[40] On January 4, 2016, Green became the second Warriors player ever to post three straight triple-doubles (the other being Tom Gola in 1959–60) as he helped Golden State record its 35th straight regular-season home win with a 111–101 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.[41] On January 28, he was named a Western Conference All-Star reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, earning his first All-Star selection.[42] On March 27, he posted his franchise-best 12th triple-double of the season in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[43] Three days later, in a win over the Utah Jazz, Green became the first player in NBA history to record 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 500 assists, 100 steals and 100 blocks in a season.[44] At the conclusion of the regular season, Green was selected to the All-NBA Second Team,[45] finished runner-up for the Defensive Player of the Year award,[46] and was named to the All-Defensive Team with the second-most votes.[47] His 13 triple-doubles were second in the league to Russell Westbrook's 18, and he broke Gola's team record of nine set in 1959–60. His 13 were the most by a non-guard in the NBA since Grant Hill's 13 in 1996–97.

The two had gotten tangled in the closing minutes of the Warriors' 108–97 win. Green fell to the ground, and James stepped over him. Feeling disrespected, Green swung his arm and appeared to make contact with James' groin.[53]After the game, Green was assessed a Flagrant 1 for contact that was ruled "unnecessary" and "retaliatory", and James was given a technical foul for taunting.

On February 10, 2017, Green scored only four points but finished with 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals as the Warriors defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 122–107. His triple-double was the first in NBA history with fewer than 10 points scored. It also was only the second in NBA history with at least 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals in a game—the first was Alvin Robertson's in 1986, when he also had 20 points. Green became the first player in NBA history to record 10 steals and five blocks in a game since the 1973–74 season, when those became official statistics.
