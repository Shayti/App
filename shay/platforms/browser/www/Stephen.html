<font size="50"><p>
Wardell Stephen Curry II (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.[1] In 2014–15, Curry won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and led the Warriors to their first championshipsince 1975. The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals for a third straight year in 2017, winning his second NBA championship.

Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, he also set the single-season NCAArecord for three-pointers made.

During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. During the 2013–14 season, he and teammate Klay Thompsonwere nicknamed the "Splash Brothers" en route to setting the NBA record for combined three-pointers in a season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525) and again in the 2015–16 season (678).

The son of Sonya (Adams) and Dell Curry, Stephen Curry was born in Akron, Ohio, while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[2][3] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[4] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother, Seth, to his games, where they would shoot around with the Hornets during warm-ups.[5] The family briefly relocated to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Toronto Raptors.[4] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[6][7] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[8][9] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[9] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship</p>
<p>
Following Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference, all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[11] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had been aggressively recruiting him from the tenth grade</p>

Standing at 6 feet 3 inches tall (1.91 m) and weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 22.4 points, 6.9 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. He has been selected to three All-NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice.[41] Since 2013, he has been ranked a top ten player in the NBA as part of ESPN's #NBArank project.[139][140][141]

Curry is considered an important leader within the Warriors organization, known for his humility and work ethic.[142][143] Curry is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors.[144]

Curry is known for his elite shooting ability; he is able to score in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half-court.[145] He is considered by many to be among the greatest scorers in NBA history.[146][147][148] [148][149] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up, adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block.[150] In addition to his quick release, he puts extra pressure on defenses with his long range, leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016.[151] As of April 2016, he ranks second in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage and holds three of the top five seasons in terms of total three-pointers made.[152][153][154] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 1,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 88 fewer games than the previous record-holder.[155] In an article for FiveThirtyEight, Benjamin Morris emphasized Curry's importance in the NBA's increasing use of the three-point shot, writing, "Curry is perhaps the figurehead in the NBA's Three-Point Revolution."[156]

Some experts have commented that Curry's elite scoring ability creates a "gravity" effect, forcing opposing defenders to double him even when he doesn't have the ball, which creates mismatches that his teammates are able to exploit.[157][158]

Curry is also known as a clutch scorer, often playing at his best in high-pressure moments, and taking game-winning shots.[159][160]
Curry is an exceptional free throw shooter, with a career free throw average of over 90% through the 2015–16 season.[161] He is currently the Warriors' all-time free-throw leader, and led the NBA in free throw shooting average in the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons.[162]
Though capable of getting steals, Curry is not considered to be an elite defender, and his teammates frequently take the more difficult defensive assignments</p>

Curry was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[41] His rookie contract was worth $12.7 million over four years.[42] In his first career game, he scored 14 points and distributed 7 assists.[43] With final season averages of 17.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals per game,[41] he finished second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting to Tyreke Evans, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[44]
At the 2011 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry won the NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge.[45] He finished the season with averages of 18.6 points, 5.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game and shot a franchise- and league-best 93.4 percent from the free throw line.[41][46] He was also the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award. </p>

<p>In May 2011, Curry had surgery on his right ankle to repair torn ligaments that were caused by multiple sprains from the season before.[50]The ankle healed in time for the start of the 2011–12 campaign, but he sprained it again during the preseason and on January 4 in a game against the San Antonio Spurs.[51][52][53] On February 22, he strained a tendon in his right foot in a game against the Phoenix Suns.[54] In April, he had another surgery.[55] In total, Curry appeared in only 26 regular season games and his scoring average dipped to 14.7 points per game.[41]

Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension with the Warriors.[56] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[57] Over the course of the year, Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname "The Splash Brothers".[58] On February 27, Curry scored a career-high 54 points in a game against the New York Knicks, setting a franchise record for three-pointers made in a game with 11 and falling just one shy of tying the NBA record.[59][60] In the final game of the season, he set a new league record for three-pointers made in a single season.[61] His final averages were 22.9 points and 6.9 assists per game.[41] The Warriors finished the year with 47 wins, earning them the sixth seed in the Western Conference and a matchup with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.[62] Golden State defeated the Nuggets in six games to advance to the second round, where Curry scored 44 points in a Game 1 loss to the Spurs.[63] The Warriors eventually lost the series in six games.[64]
In December of the 2013–14 season, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[65] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance, starting for the West.[66] Behind averages of 24 points and 8.5 assists per game, he was selected to his first All-NBA Team.[41] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive year, the Warriors drew the Los Angeles Clippers to begin the postseason.[67] In Game 4, Curry scored 33 points, including a then playoff career-high seven three-pointers, in a winning effort.[68] Golden State went on to lose the series in seven games</p>
<p>
On July 1, 2017, Curry agreed to a five-year, $201 million extension with the Warriors, becoming the first NBA player to sign a supermax contract, the crossing of a $200 million threshold.[133] He officially signed the contract on July 25.[134]
